    <h2>Valid column definition formats</h2>

    <p>
        There are numerous ways to specify a column for a datatable, depending on what you need to
        accomplish.  The following formats are all valid ways to write a column definition in a
        view's <code>datatable_options</code>:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
datatable_options = {
    'columns': [
        # "concrete" field backed by the database
        'name',  # field's verbose_name will be used
        ("Name", 'name'),  # custom verbose name provided
        ("Name", 'name', 'callback_attr_name'),  # callback looked up on view
        ("Name", 'name', callback_handle),  # calback used directly

        # non-field, but backed by methods, properties, etc
        "Virtual Field",

        # "fake" virtual field whose data is generated by the view
        ("Virtual Field", None, 'callback_attr_name'),
        ("Virtual Field", None, callback_handle),
    ],
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        For concrete fields that also provide callbacks, the actual database value will be consulted
        during searches and sorts, but the table will use the return value of the callback as the
        display data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Virtual fields are useful ways to mount methods onto a table.  Consider a read-only property
        that generates its return value based on some underlying database field:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
datatable_options = {
    'columns': [
        ("Average profit", 'get_average_profit'),
    ],
}
    </pre>
    
    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        Be careful with virtual columns that might cause database queries per-row.  That doesn't
        scale very well!
    </p>
